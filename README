image front detection by image processing
restrictions:
1. front should progress vs time along x axis.
2. front should have same position along y axis.

Input:  image sequence as a dense volume: (x,y,t) i.e. (x,y) image and t time.
Output: graph with x position vs time with several i algorithm, i.e. (i,xp,t).
Algorithm: 4 presently
1. mean along y
1.0. average volume along y axis giving a (x,t) data
1.1. get fixed   threshold position (i=0)
1.2. get dynamic threshold position (i=1)
2. histogram based
2.0. position for each lines (for looop along y axis) then setup position histogram data
2.1. get average position (i=2)
2.2. get maximum position (i=3)

For compilation, see _info.txt (need CImg library see http://cimg.sourceforge.net/)

Run: show all options (both command line and compilation ones) using:
  ./front -h -I
